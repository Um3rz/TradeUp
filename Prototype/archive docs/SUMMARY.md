# TradeUp Project - Summary of Recent Work

## What Was Done

### 1. Fixed Syntax Errors ✓

**Problem**: The frontend build was failing due to merge conflict markers in `frontend/lib/userService.ts`

**Solution**: 
- Removed all merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
- Cleaned up the file to use the imported `API_BASE_URL` from `./api`
- Preserved all functionality including console.log statements

**Result**: Frontend now builds successfully with no syntax errors

**Created**: `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive document detailing all Phase 2 changes

**Key Sections**:
- Trading System implementation (buy/sell, portfolio, transactions)

- User Profile Management (profile updates, profile pictures)
